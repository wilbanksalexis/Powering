# Basic Website (starter)

This is a minimal static website starter created for quick previews and small demos.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main HTML page
- `styles.css` — basic responsive CSS
- `script.js` — tiny JS for mobile nav and demo form handling
- `assets/` — place to add images or other static assets

How to preview

1) Open the file directly in your browser

   - Double-click `index.html` in Finder or
   - From Terminal: `open index.html`

2) Or run a tiny local server (recommended for relative assets)

```bash
# from the project folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps (suggestions)

- Replace the placeholder content with your own text and images in `assets/`.
- Hook the contact form to a backend or a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- Add accessibility improvements and performance optimizations for production.
